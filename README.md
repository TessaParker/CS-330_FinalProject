# CS-330_FinalProject
Project created for the Computational Graphics and Visualization course at SNHU to render a 3D scene.

Here's a little bit about my experience in this course:

[1] How do I approach designing software?

I feel that in every course, I learn more about proper software planning and design. As each new idea is introduced, there is a different workflow that I must learn. I think that this has enabled me to become more flexible to adapt to new code structures and information. In this course, once I had grasped a better understanding of what we were trying to accomplish, I began by creating the foundational shapes. After this, I found it more intuitive to bind the textures and then work with the placement of the objects. In the future, I may find more efficient ways to accomplish these same tasks. I hope to continue to develop my skills with OpenGL.

[2] How do I approach developing programs?

I encountered numerous foreign concepts to me throughout this course. I won't lie, this led me into a LOT of trial and error. But through making mistakes and adding new elements, I feel that I was really beginning to better understand and grasp the concepts that we were using by the end of the course. Iteration was certainly an important element of gaining a better understanding of OpenGL.

[3] How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This course has been the most challenging of any that I have encountered thus far in my studies. Even if I do not specifically encounter computational graphics in my future studies or career, I feel that exercising patience and overcoming challenges has been a wonderful (yet stressful) learning experience. While I feel that my end product did not measure up to some of my classmates', I do feel a sense of accomplishment that I was able to achieve as much as I did despite my struggles in this course.
